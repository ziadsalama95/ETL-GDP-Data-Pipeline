# ETL-GDP-Data-Pipeline

This project demonstrates the creation of an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that extracts GDP data from a web source, transforms it and loads it into both a CSV file and a SQLite database. Additionally, the project includes querying the database to extract relevant information and logging the entire ETL process.

## Project Overview

This project was designed as a hands-on lab to practice ETL operations on real-world data. The goal is to automate the extraction, transformation and loading of GDP data from a given URL, making it accessible as a CSV file and a database table.

### Objectives
- Extract relevant GDP information from a website.
- Transform the data from USD (Millions) to USD (Billions).
- Load the transformed data into a CSV file and a SQLite database.
- Query the database to find countries with GDPs over 100 billion USD.
- Log the entire ETL process.

## Features
- **Data Extraction**: Extracts country-wise GDP data from a specified URL.
- **Data Transformation**: Converts GDP values from millions to billions and rounds them to two decimal places.
- **Data Loading**: Loads the data into a CSV file and an SQLite database.
- **Query Execution**: Filters and retrieves countries with GDPs over 100 billion USD.
- **Logging**: Logs each step of the ETL process with timestamps.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- `beautifulsoup4`
- `requests`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `sqlite3` (built-in with Python)
- `datetime` (built-in with Python)

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests pandas numpy
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ETL-GDP-Data-Pipeline.git
   cd ETL-GDP-Data-Pipeline
   ```

2. **Run the Jupyter notebook:**

   Open `etl_project_gdp.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and run all the cells to execute the ETL process.

3. **Check the outputs:**

   - **CSV File**: `Countries_by_GDP.csv` will contain the extracted and transformed GDP data.
   - **Database File**: `World_Economies.db` will have a table `Countries_by_GDP` with the GDP data.
   - **Log File**: `etl_project_log.txt` will contain the logs of the ETL process.

## Results

After running the notebook, you will obtain a CSV file and an SQLite database containing the GDP data. The notebook also queries the database to find countries with GDPs exceeding 100 billion USD and logs each step of the process.
